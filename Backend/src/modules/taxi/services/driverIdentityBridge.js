/**
 * Resolves a food delivery-partner identity to its unified taxi Driver.
 *
 * One person, two documents: a driver who signs in through the delivery app
 * gets a food-issued token (role DELIVERY_PARTNER, sub = partner id), but every
 * /taxi route and the dispatch socket room key off the taxi Driver id. Without
 * this translation the delivery app is refused by /taxi/* and never joins
 * driver:<id>, so no ride can ever reach it.
 *
 * Returns the original payload untouched for any other role, and for a partner
 * that has not been linked by the unification backfill — those are rejected
 * exactly as they were before, rather than silently gaining taxi access.
